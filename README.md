# miri-react-native-sdk-examples

Examples for the [Miri React Native SDK](https://www.miri.ai/developer/docs/alpha)

## Authentication

All examples in this repo use [google signin](https://react-native-google-signin.github.io/docs/original) to authenticate with `@miri-ai/miri-react-native`. You can also use `firebase` and `apple` authentication. You'll need to create a Client ID for IOS to test in the IOS simulator.
